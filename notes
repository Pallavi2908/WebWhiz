Given the project's nature (and to keep costs low and avoid extra API dependencies), I recommend starting with the **free Hugging Face model** (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). It is:

- Lightweight (only 80MB)
- Fast (about 0.15 seconds per embedding on CPU)
- Good for semantic similarity tasks

which vector DB to use: chromaDB

1. quick acess to data w/o high latency
2. high throughput
3. scalable

how ChromaDB is useful for this case:
LLM-Centric Design:

Purpose-built for semantic search in NLP applications

Optimized for exactly your query-similarity matching use case

Seamless integration with LangChain and LLM workflows

Simplified Architecture:

---python -m playwright install :
It downloads and installs browser binaries (like headless Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) that Playwright needs to run and automate browsers.
